Bread Recipe

Ingredients:

- 2 teaspoons of yeast
- 5 cups of flour
- 2 and 1/4 cups of warm water (110 F)
- 3 and 1/2 tablespoons of sugar, divided
- 1 tablespoon of salt

Directions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the yeast, 1/2 tablespoon of sugar, and warm water. Stir well and let it sit for about 10 minutes, or until bubbles appear on the surface.
2. In another bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar, salt, and flour.
3. Add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture and mix well with a wooden spoon or a stand mixer until a smooth dough forms.
4. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover it with a damp cloth. Let it rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until doubled in size.
5. Preheat the oven to 375Â° F and lightly grease a baking sheet.
6. Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place it on the prepared baking sheet and make a few slashes on the top with a sharp knife.
7. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.
8. Enjoy your homemade bread! ðŸ˜Š
