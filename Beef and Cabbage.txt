Beef and Cabbage

Ingredients:

- 1 pound of ground beef, preferably grass-fed
- 1 onion, diced
- 1/2 to 1 head of cabbage, cored and chopped
- 1 tablespoon of butter
- 1 garlic clove, peeled and minced
- 1 can (14.5 ounces) of diced tomatoes
- 1 can (8 ounces) of tomato sauce or pasta sauce
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:

1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the beef, breaking it into small pieces, until browned and cooked through. Drain the excess fat if desired.
2. Add the onion and garlic to the same skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and fragrant, about 10 minutes.
3. Add the butter, cabbage, tomatoes, tomato sauce, salt, and pepper and stir well to combine.
4. Cover the skillet with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the mixture for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender.
